# Spark_Up
It’s a funding platform for project ideas that allows regular users – not necessarily investors – to donate to the idea they like.

The person who submits the idea on the platform sets the amount of money they need for their idea or project (if it’s already on the ground). When the exact target amount is reached, the idea automatically closes and is removed from the platform.

Users can request a refund if they want, and the idea owner, if they feel the collected amount is sufficient even if the target hasn’t been fully reached, can choose to withdraw the funds from the site.
